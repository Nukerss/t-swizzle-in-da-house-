This is a picture of the beauty herself, her body glowing in an otherwise depressing world. She is the one beacon of hope that I cling on to every day and I hope one day I get to touch her. She was actually the first person to cure cancer in this world and should be an inspiration for all you dank memers out there (i.e. the brians and willies of this earth). Thank you for your time and I hope you learned something new from this nerd website.
